## A foray into embedded Real Time Operating Systems for the NXP LPC8xx series MCUs

This repository details the progress of developing an embedded, lightweight, real time operating system for the NXP LPC8xx series of micro-controllers.

This is a first time looking into operating system development, so code is likely to be rough around the edges. I eventually hope to have a full development suite that includes simulation and unit tests. QEMU doesn't yet support the M0+ so that might be another project, but in the meantime I'll be simulating the code in Keil and on some development boards for specific hardware testing.
